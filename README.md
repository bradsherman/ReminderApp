# TODO App
### Brad Sherman

This app is a dockerized version of the popular TODO application that uses various frameworks like Node.js, Angular.js, React.js, and GraphQL to present and handle the data in the same way but with different technologies. It uses a MongoDB database to persist each note. This project mainly serves as a way for me to learn more about each of these technologies.
