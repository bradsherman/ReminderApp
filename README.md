# Reminder App
### Brad Sherman

This app is a dockerized spinoff of the popular TODO application that uses various frameworks like Node.js, Angular.js, React.js, and GraphQL to present and handle the data in the same way but with different technologies. It uses a MongoDB database to persist each note. This project mainly serves as a way for me to learn more about each of these technologies.

The main premise of this application is to allow a group of people to set reminders that may apply to one or more of them in a centralized place.
